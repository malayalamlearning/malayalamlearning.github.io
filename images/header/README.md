## Header Images

These are optional and shown on the content in the page header, if omitted then plain blue background is used instead

Set in the front matter as follows

```yaml
header:
  overlay_image: /images/header/foobar.png
```

## Guidelines

- Images should be JPEG as they maybe quite large
- Images should a good size as they will stretch across the screen
