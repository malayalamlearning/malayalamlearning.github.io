## Introduction

The main Azure portal is <a href="https://portal.azure.com" target="portal">https://portal.azure.com</a>.

Login using the account for your Azure subscription.

## Create/Setup IoT Hub instance

IoT Hub is the cloud gateway, which is the entrypoint for your devices or field gateways to 
send messages to the Cloud.

- Click on **+ create a resource** in the top left corner of the portal
- Select on **Internet of Things** in the newly opened blade
- Select **IoT Hub**
- Give a unique name for your IoT hub for e.g., **iothubpractice** (you can give the name of your choice)
- Select the pricing tier, you can choose the **F1 Free tier**
- Under IoT Hub Units enter 1 as units which determines the number of messages in your daily quota
- For Device to Cloud partitions select 4 partitions - your messages will be divided into the configured number
or partitions in the IoT Hub
- Select your subscription, in my case it is **Microsoft Azure Internal Subscription** (Note: You might have a different subscription)
- Resource Group - A resource group is a logical grouping of the resources which helps to easily manage the related resources. You can use any existing resource group or create a new one for e.g., **iot_hub_labs_rg** 
- Select the location as **WEST EUROPE** and click on create button - this may take few minutes to initialize your IoT Instance
    - **You can navigate to the IoT Hub instance once created:**
    - Notification bell is on the top right corner which shows the status of the IoT Hub setup, once completed;
    - Click on notification bell and click on **Go to resource** button
- Congrats! you have now setup your IoT Hub instance

------------------------------------------------------------------

## Setup a device identity

-   Access the IoT Hub instance through the portal
    - Click on **All Resources** - this will list all the resources under your subscription
    - Select the IoT Hub instance created in previous step for e.g., **iothubpractice**
-   Scroll through the options in the newly opened blade and select **IoT Devices**
-   Click on **+ Add** button
-   Give a unique device id say **iot-practice-dev**
-   Select authentication type as **Symmettric Key**
-   Check the Auto Generate Keys
-   Check the Enable under **Connect device to IoT Hub**
-   Click on save

## (Next Steps - Optional) Simulate a device on your machine and send messages to your IoT Hub instance

- Refer to below link for simulating a device and sending messages to IoT Hub in your preferred lanugage,
