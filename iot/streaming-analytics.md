## Create Azure Streaming Analytics Job

Streaming Analytics is a managed event stream processing engine which can be used to perform realtime analytics on the streaming data.

- Click on **+ create a resource** in the top left corner of the portal
- Select on **Internet of Things** in the newly opened blade
- Select **Stream Analytics Job**
- Give a unique name for your Streaming analytics job for e.g., **streaming-event-agg-test-job** (you can give the name of your choice)
- Select your subscription, in my case it is **Microsoft Azure Internal Subscription** (Note: You might have a different subscription)
- Resource Group - A resource group is a logical grouping of the resources which helps to easily manage the related resources. You can use any existing resource group or create a new one for e.g., **stream_analytics_labs_rg** 
- Select the location as **WEST EUROPE**
- Select appropriate hosting environment either Cloud or Edge. For this labs choose **Cloud** as hosting environment as we will be running this streaming job on the cloud. Note: If you want to deploy the streaming job on an IoT edge device then you can select Edge 
- Click **create**, this will start initializing your streaming analytics job
    - **You can navigate to the streaming analytics job once created:**
    - Notification bell is on the top right corner which shows the status of the Streaming analytics job setup, once completed;
    - Click on notification bell and click on **Go to resource** button
- Congrats! you have now setup your Streaming Analytics job

-   Upload the sensor data file 
-   Click on the gear button on the top area - this will display the contents of the file uploaded 
-   You can filter, aggregate, join the dimensional data etc for e.g., change the Query as below

```
SELECT
    System.timestamp as OutputTime,
    dspl as sensorname,
    avg(TEMP) as avgtemperature
INTO
    [YourOutputAlias]
FROM
    [YourInputAlias]
GROUP BY TumblingWindow(SECOND, 30), dspl
HAVING AVG(TEMP) > 70;
```
-   Click on save

## (Optional) Configure IoT Hub, Event Hubs as the inputs for Streaming Analytics Job
