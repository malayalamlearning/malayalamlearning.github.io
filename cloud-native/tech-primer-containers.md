excerpt: Overview of containers & Docker, with deeper dive for learning & reference 
---

My second technical primer, this one covers containers & Docker. Aimed at people that want to understand containers, what they are, how to use them and also get started with Docker. The guide goes into medium technical depth, examples of commands but is not intended as a comprehensive end to end reference.  

This content can be used for presentations, used in labs & exercises but also given as handout/reading material.
