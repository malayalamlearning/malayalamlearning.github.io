## Introduction

The Azure Citadel site is hosted in GitHub pages.  This allows contributors to  documentation using standard markdown.

Once committed to the main repository then the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/) engine takes the markdown and then renders it as the static HTML you see on [Azure Citadel](https://azurecitadel.com).

## Content

The content on Citadel is only ever intended to complement the official Azure documentation.  In the UK we use it actively to help partners achieve a step change in their Azure capabilities as we build new practices and propositions.  But as a community site it has proved popular, especially when using lengthier labs to combine various Azure and open source products and tooling.

Much of the content is hosted directly within the <https://github.com/azurecitadel/azurecitadel.github.io> repository, but we also have a number of contributors who maintain the labs in their own repositories (where they have full read/write access) and then create landing pages with Azure Citadel as another channel for users to discover those labs.

As of January 2019 we have moved to a new site theme, so we will start by covering off on some of the reasons for that change.  If you are interested in contributing then this guide will go through the various areas.  Please use the comments area
