excerpt: ARM overview & deep dive for learning & reference 
---

First in a series of "tech primers" on a range of topics. Created for a technical audience, that might be new to a particular topic or domain. I wanted to solve several things with these primers, combining both introductory overview content, but also technical reference material and deeper dives into various key areas.

If you're new to Azure and especially the Azure Resource Manager, this guide is a handy place to get started

This content can be used for presentations, used in labs & exercises but also given as handout/reading material.
