----------

<div class="danger">NOTICE: This workshop will be removed at the end of March.  For those who are new to Azure then we highly recommend the Azure learning paths within Microsoft Learn.</div>

The session needs to be delivered as a workshop, whereas the newer content on this site is intended to be usable both in that context and as self serve material. The Portal and Virtual Machine labs will also be retired, but the Web App and Logic Apps labs will be moved into the Fundamentals category.

----------

## Introduction

The Azure 101 session is intended as an introductory training for technical learners who have had little to no experience with Azure public cloud.

The aim is to familiarise the student with some of the most commonly used IaaS and PaaS services in Azure, and the portal and CLI interfaces available to drive them.

In terms of orientation, the trainer may use slides to help give an overview of some of the other services available within Azure, and the training will also make the student aware of some of the documentation and training resources available to them as they continue to explore.

Allow five hours for a full session including all of the labs.

## Pre-requisites

The workshop requires the following
